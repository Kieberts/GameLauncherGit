GameLauncher
School project with a little bit of webscraping.

One of our school projects is to build a simple gamelauncher with some features.

It must have a user GUI
You can add "Games" (can be just a local program like notepad), edit "games".
You can start the "game" from the Gamelauncher
I added a few features. There is also a webscraper coded, but it only works if you change the Steamgames Folder string with your own Steamgames folder.

Feel free to give me some feedback and some tips :)
